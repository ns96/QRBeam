Basic Web App for transfering data through QR Codes

## Introduction
This web application leverages the camera capabilities of smartphones to decode data from QR Codes. The user inputs the data (text, numbers, etc.) into the HTML form, then the it dynamically generates a series of QR Codes, each containing a portion of the data and an index to aid in reassembeling the data. Through the use of their smartphone and companion [decoding wep app](qrscan.html), the user can scan these QR Codes and retrieve the original data. This method allows for offline data transfer between devices without requiring internet connectivity or the use of removable storage like USB drives.
